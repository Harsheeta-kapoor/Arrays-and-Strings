Arrays and String Questions Solved

# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS ðŸ’¯

#### 1. Hello , in this repository we will do Arrays and String questions from basic to advance level .
#### 2. We will use Java Programming language for solving the questions 
#### 3. The questions solved in this repo are as follows :
    1. Reverse a String: Write a function to reverse a given string. For example, if the input is "hello," the output should be "olleh." 
    
    2. Find Duplicate Elements in an Array: Given an array of integers, write a function to find and return any duplicate elements present in the array. 
    
    3. Array Rotation: Implement a function to rotate an array to the left or right by a given number of steps. For instance, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation is 2 steps to the left, the output should be [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. 
    
    4. Find Missing Element in Array: Given an array containing integers from 1 to n (where n is the length of the array + 1), find the missing element in the array. 
   
    5. Longest Substring without Repeating Characters: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, in the string "abcabcbb," the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc" with a length of 3. 
    
    6. Array Intersection: Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays. Return a new array containing the common elements present in both arrays. 
    
    7. Anagrams: Given two strings, write a function to determine whether they are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are strings that contain the same characters in a different order. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams. 
   
    8. Two Sum Problem: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value. Return the indices of the two numbers.
    
    9. Count Palindromes: Write a function to count all palindrome substrings in a given string. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
    
    10. Array Partitioning: Given an array of integers, rearrange the elements such that all the even numbers come before the odd numbers, and the relative order of even and odd numbers remains the same.
    
    11. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS): Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. For example, in the array [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80], the LIS is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80] with a length of 6.
    
    12. Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum. For example, in the array [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the maximum subarray sum is 6 (the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1]).
    
    13. Coin Change: Given a target amount and a list of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. This is a classic coin change problem.
   
    14. Edit Distance: Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations (insert, remove, or replace) required to convert one string into another.
    
    15. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Given two strings, find the length of the longest common subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order but not necessarily contiguous.
    
    16. Palindrome Partitioning: Given a string, divide it into the minimum number of palindromes (substrings that read the same forward and backward).
   
    17. Word Break: Given a string and a dictionary of words, determine if the string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of words from the dictionary.
    
    18. Longest Palindromic Substring: Given a string, find the longest substring that is a palindrome.
    
    19. Minimum Window Substring: Given two strings S and T, find the minimum window in S that contains all the characters from T.
    
    20. Regular Expression Matching: Given a string S and a pattern P, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' (Matches any character) and '*' (matches zero or more of the preceding element)
