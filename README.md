Arrays and String Questions Solved

# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS ðŸ’¯

#### 1. Hello , in this repository we will do Arrays and String questions from basic to advance level .
#### 2. We will use Java Programming language for solving the questions 
#### 3. The String questions solved in this repo are as follows :
    1. Reverse a String: Write a function to reverse a given string. For example, if the input is "hello," the output should be "olleh." 
    2. Find Duplicate Elements in an Array: Given an array of integers, write a function to find and return any duplicate elements present in the array. 
    3. Array Rotation: Implement a function to rotate an array to the left or right by a given number of steps. For instance, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation is 2 steps to the left, the output should be [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. 
    4. Find Missing Element in Array: Given an array containing integers from 1 to n (where n is the length of the array + 1), find the missing element in the array. 
    5. Longest Substring without Repeating Characters: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, in the string "abcabcbb," the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc" with a length of 3. 
    6. Array Intersection: Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays. Return a new array containing the common elements present in both arrays. 
    7. Anagrams: Given two strings, write a function to determine whether they are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are strings that contain the same characters in a different order. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams. 
    8. Two Sum Problem: Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value. Return the indices of the two numbers.
    9. Count Palindromes: Write a function to count all palindrome substrings in a given string. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
    10. Array Partitioning: Given an array of integers, rearrange the elements such that all the even numbers come before the odd numbers, and the relative order of even and odd numbers remains the same.
